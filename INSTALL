Besides interpreted Javascript code this Chrome extension uses 
a native client app that includes the exiv2 C++ library. Since 
the extension cannot access the library directly, an app works
as a wrapper. To use the extension, you have to build the app and 
place the executables in bin/ before deploying the extension.
Details see below.

You may use the binary files included in this repository.
They were built using pepper_33. If you do not want to build
newer binaries, just do step 0 and 9.


== Build on Linux & Install everywhere --- as it worked in February 2014 ==
verified on OS X 10.7 in June 2014

0. You already got the Chrome extension from github
   - cd <anywhere> 
   - git clone https://github.com/bhenne/ChromeExtension-PhotoMetadataPrivacy.git
   - export PATH_TO_THIS_INSTALL_FILE=`pwd`/ChromeExtension-PhotoMetadataPrivacy

1. Base directory
   - export MYBASE=/tmp
   - mkdir $MYBASE/dev

2. Obtain Native Client SDK
   (see https://developers.google.com/native-client/dev/sdk/download)
   - cd $MYBASE/dev
   - wget http://storage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/nacl_sdk.zip
   - unzip nacl_sdk.zip
   - cd nacl_sdk
   - ./naclsdk update

3. Obtain depot_tools
   (see http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools)
   - cd $MYBASE/dev
   - git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
   - export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/depot_tools

4. Obtain naclports
   (see https://code.google.com/p/naclports/)
   - cd $MYBASE/dev
   - mkdir naclports
   - cd naclports
   - gclient config --name=src  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/naclports.git
   - gclient sync

5. Include exiv2 in naclports
   - cd $MYBASE/dev
   - git clone https://github.com/bhenne/naclports-exiv2.git
   - cd naclports-exiv2
   - cp -r ports/exiv2 $MYBASE/dev/naclports/src/ports/

6. Build exiv2 and dependencies
   - cd $MYBASE/dev/naclports/src
   - export NACL_SDK_ROOT=$MYBASE/dev/nacl_sdk/pepper_35
   - unset NACL_GLIBC
   - export NACL_ARCH=i686
   - make exiv2
   - export NACL_ARCH=x86_64
   - make exiv2

7. Build exiv2 wrapper
   - cd $PATH_TO_THIS_INSTALL_FILE
   - export NACL_SDK_ROOT=$MYBASE/dev/nacl_sdk/pepper_35
   - export NACL_ARCH=x86_32
   - CONFIG=Release make
   - export NACL_ARCH=x86_64
   - CONFIG=Release make

8. Install exiv2 wrapper
   - cp newlib/Release/photo_metadata_privacy_x86_32.nexe $PATH_TO_THIS_INSTALL_FILE/bin/
   - cp newlib/Release/photo_metadata_privacy_x86_64.nexe $PATH_TO_THIS_INSTALL_FILE/bin/
   - rm -fr newlib/

9. Install Chrome extension from filesystem
   - open chrome://extensions/
   - enable "Developer mode"
   - "load unpacked extension..."
   - select the directory located at $PATH_TO_THIS_INSTALL_FILE
   - press select

Have a try.


== Error handling ==

Error:
  $ make exiv2
  build_tools/naclports.py install exiv2
  naclports: $NACL_SDK_ROOT does not exist: /Users/henne/dev/nacl_sdk/pepper_33
  make: *** [exiv2] Error 1

A newer version of pepper is available as you may have noticed when running:
  $ ./naclsdk update
  Downloading bundle pepper_35

Just do a correct SDK path declaration
  export NACL_SDK_ROOT=$MYBASE/dev/nacl_sdk/pepper_35
