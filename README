= Chrome Browser Extension: Photo Metadata Privacy =

A Chrome browser extension that visualizes privacy-relevant image metadata
to users. Based on libexiv2 and Google Native Client the extension reads
Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata from files and visualizes the data according
to different groups of personal data. Complex metadata as person tags 
or location are specially visualized. Technical metadata is blinded 
by default, but can also be visualized.

As a proof of concept the extension allows for modifying metadata 
on-the-fly while uploading a photo via a basic HTML form.

The base version of this extension was implemented within the bachelor 
thesis of Maximilian Koch at the Distributed Computing & Security Group 
at the Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, Germany. The topic was outlined
and the thesis was advised by Benjamin Henne. The base version was
extended by Maximilian Koch advised by Benjamin Henne within a 
master studies project.

Technical details of the base version can be found in 
 Maximilian Koch: "A browser extension to increase photo metadata
 transparency and security on the Web", bachelor thesis (German).

The extension has been published in Henne et al.: "On the Awareness, 
 Control and Privacy of Photo Metadata", Financial Cryptography and 
 Data Security 2014, volume 8437 of LNCS, Springer.
